This project is a bash script that automates the process of creating various types of backups for files in a specified directory. It continuously runs in the background, periodically creating complete, incremental, and differential backups to ensure comprehensive data protection.
The script intelligently monitors the file system for changes and creates backups accordingly. It generates compressed tar archives for complete backups, capturing all files in the directory tree. Incremental backups capture only the newly created or modified files since the previous backup, minimizing redundancy and storage requirements.
Additionally, the script maintains a log file that meticulously records each backup operation, including timestamps, backup file names, and status messages. This log provides a clear audit trail and aids in tracking backup activities.
The project is designed to be configurable and extensible, allowing customization of backup intervals, directories, and other parameters based on specific requirements. It showcases proficiency in bash scripting, file system operations, and backup strategies, making it a valuable addition to any system administration or data management toolkit.
